            <p className="text-base">You are one of the very first people to ever use Cassius! We are so excited for you to use v1, and can't wait to see how much it helps with your marketing.</p>
            <p className="text-base">We built this product because we spent years in early-stage businesses, doing every kind of marketing and distribution. It's manual, repetitive, time-consuming, and rarely fun (often, actually very painful).</p>
            <p className="text-base">Most startups fail at distribution because they don't have the time, skill, or resources to execute marketing at the quality and scale required to win. </p>
            <p className="text-base">So, we built the most intuitive and intelligent marketing platform in the world, which gives you expert and truly actionable strategies based on what works right now in marketing, and allows you to orchestrate everything through one chat interface.</p>
            <p className="text-base">Our hope is that Cassius makes marketing feel clearer, faster, much more enjoyable â€“ and ultimately, drives incredible customers to your business.</p>
            <p className="text-base">Tell us what feels useful, what feels confusing, and what you'd like to see next (based on the core things you actually care about).</p>
            <p className="text-base">Your feedback at this stage will shape the future of Cassius more than anything else. Can't wait to hear your feedback and thoughts.</p>
